        <h2>Manifesto and Health Guide</h2>
        <p>
            I am a multifaceted individual whose identity is dynamic and ever-evolving. Joining a new academic organization
            revealed my reserved side, contrasting with how my long-time friends see me: as a social butterfly with wit,
            adaptability, and care. I embrace my duality, learning to navigate challenges with creativity while maintaining
            authenticity and meaningful connections.
        </p>
        <p>
            My Filipino values, such as pakikisama and bayanihan, deeply influence my relationships. I strive to build
            harmonious connections and support others, embodying the “kuya” role to those around me. This journey has
            taught me to accept myself, balancing self-improvement with self-love and prioritizing mental health as part
            of overall well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
            Health is more than the absence of illness; it is a holistic state of physical, mental, emotional, and social
            balance. My health guide includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Health:</strong> Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and prioritizing quality sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Mindfulness, setting boundaries, and fostering positivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Health:</strong> Open communication, self-reflection, and gratitude.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Health:</strong> Building meaningful relationships, giving back, and protecting my energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Through these practices, I aim to live a life of balance, purpose, and fulfillment, honoring my authentic self
            and striving for growth every day.

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>
            Reflecting on the lessons from the modules and the feedback from others has helped me better understand myself 
            and how I present to the world. The modules on perspectives of self, identity development, and mental health 
            showed me how my experiences and environment shape who I am. Joining an academic organization this semester 
            pushed me into unfamiliar social settings, and many of my new orgmates described me as shy, quiet, and soft-spoken. 
            While this might be a common first impression, I recognize that I tend to hold back until I feel comfortable. This 
            reserved side contrasts with how my high school friends see me. They describe me as a social butterfly who thrives 
            in spontaneous social situations, always ready to make people laugh and lighten the mood. This duality reflects my 
            adaptability—being cautious in new environments but warm and outgoing with those I trust.
        </p>
        <p>
            The modules on personality and biological influences helped me see how my traits shape my behavior in different 
            settings. For example, my witty and resourceful personality helps me solve problems creatively, as my high school 
            friends compared me to an octopus—quick to adapt and think outside the box in challenging situations. This adaptability 
            is a core part of my identity, reflecting how I manage stress and navigate change. Similarly, my caring and supportive 
            nature stood out in the module on mental health and well-being. My friends likened me to a “kuya,” someone they turn to 
            for guidance, comfort, and reassurance. This feedback resonates with how I see myself—as someone who values relationships 
            and finds purpose in supporting others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Culture and ethnicity also influence how I interact with others. Growing up in the Philippines, values like pakikisama 
            (camaraderie) and bayanihan (helping others) deeply influence my approach to relationships. Whether with my new orgmates 
            or old friends, I strive to embody these values by fostering connections and showing genuine care. The module on body 
            image reminded me of the importance of self-acceptance, which I continue to work on as I navigate insecurities, 
            particularly in new social settings. Meanwhile, exploring sexuality has encouraged me to embrace my authentic self 
            and respect the diversity of others' experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Integrating these insights with the impressions shared by others, I realize how multi-dimensional my identity is. While 
            I may appear reserved in some settings, my personality is far more complex—balancing introversion and extroversion, wit 
            and care, caution and spontaneity. These reflections have taught me that identity is not static but ever-evolving, shaped 
            by experiences, relationships, and self-discovery. Understanding myself better allows me to bridge the gap between how I 
            see myself and how others see me, creating opportunities to grow and deepen connections. Ultimately, this journey of 
            self-awareness helps me embrace my strengths and work on areas for improvement, fostering a more authentic and fulfilling 
            sense of self.
